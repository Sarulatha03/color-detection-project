# color-detection-project
Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. for humans this is an extremely easy task but for computers, it is not straightforward. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color. we have mapped certain lights with their color names. We will be using the somewhat same strategy to detect color names.
color detection using python it uses some libraries like opencv pandas and numpy to detect color in a image.

2. Now launch the anaconda navigator and from there open the vscode.
3.In the vscode, open the folder in which you extracted the project files.
4. Now open new terminal in vscode and import some libraries which are necessary for the project by using this command. pip install opencv-python pandas numpy
S.After installing this libraries all you need to is run the .py file. For running the this file you have to use this command. python color detection.py -i <add your image path here>
6.I am using sample image given in the project files you can use any image, just you have to add full path of that image.
7. Now for detecting the color you have to just hover over the image and double click on the window to know the name of the pixel color.
