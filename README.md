# color-detection-project
Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. for humans this is an extremely easy task but for computers, it is not straightforward. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color. we have mapped certain lights with their color names. We will be using the somewhat same strategy to detect color names.
